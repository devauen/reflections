Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When i would like to share my work with somebody or with myself using different machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: I would like to share publicly only working versions not all versions i'm working on. As well i would like to work on my project indendently from my collabaratives.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: I will use fork when i want to clone repository from one user and use it as another user. I will use clone when i would like to work on a repository on my local computer. Branches i will use to work separetly on version that is not in my master branch.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: We can know the state of our project all the time, so we can update accordingly.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A: I'll probably create shared repository and communicate through some messaging system. Git would be easier. because it's advance tool specially dedicated for this purposes. Learning Git and learning new work system would be a harder, but it's worth it.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A: When i collaborate with other people and we need to consult the changes of our project. We can do changes in the separate branch, living the master branch unchanged and with working project.

Working only in the master branch is maybe easier in a mayopic view, because we need to do less worki with git, but it's limitting our full projecting and collaborating options.
